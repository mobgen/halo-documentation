When you want to create a native application that uses some of the features included in HALO you will need
to create a new application in HALO and configure its permissions to access the content. Accessing
the applications menu you will be able to:

- Create, update or delete an application if you have the 'Manage applications' permission.
- Enable FCM notifications by adding the application's token.
- Enable certain content structures to the application.
- Get the data needed from the apps to configure the credentials (client id and client secret).
- Enable extra security verification for google and facebook login tokens.

Once you have your applications created it is really easy to link to them some content and enable 
this the access to the data in the native applications by using the SDK.
