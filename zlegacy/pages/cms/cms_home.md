## Introduction

HALO is an MBaaS (Mobile Backend as a Service) that was developed to increase developer productivity and decrease an applicationâ€™s time-to-market by creating a highly modular CMS. A native development team will be able to hook up with HALO in a matter of minutes via the SDK which uses an open API.

MBaaS is described in wikipedia as follows:

Mobile Backend as a service (MBaaS), also known as "backend as a service" (BaaS), is a model for providing web and mobile app developers with a way to link their applications to backend cloud storage and APIs exposed by back end applications while also providing features such as user management, push notifications, and integration with social networking services. These services are provided via the use of custom software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs). BaaS is a relatively recent development in cloud computing, with most BaaS startups dating from 2011 or later. Although a fairly nascent industry, trends indicate that these services are gaining mainstream traction with enterprise consumers.
