You may want to reset your password because you forgot it or just for security reasons. In this case you can access
a form in the login screen to reset it securely:

1. Click on '*Forgot your password?*'.
2. In the form that appears enter the email you used to register the account on HALO.
3. If the email entered was valid, you will receive an email with a link you can click on to reset your password.
4. A new form will appear to allow you to enter the new password.

{% include note.html content="This form will not notify you if this was the correct account to avoid attackers to retrieve the emails we have stored in halo." %}

At this point your new password should be available and you can login again using it.
