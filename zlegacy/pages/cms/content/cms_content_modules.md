## What is a content structure?

When you are working with the content management using HALO you will work with content structures and content items.
A content structure is the definition of the structure of content items. Imagine you want to build a *library*, then you will
need books, subscribers and retrievals. Each of this entities is a different content structure and have to be created with
the needed structure.

Content items are each of the items that comply the structure of a content structure, so if we keep going with the same example, a content structure called
books can have content items of books, which is the real data.

## Operations over a content structure

### Create a content structure

- Access the left panel menu '*Content*'.
- In the action button bar, click on the '*Create new structure*' button.
- Enter the name and select if this structure is single or not. Single structures can have only one content item.
- Start configuring your content structure.

It is possible to select the columns that are going to be displayed in the content structure list view. The '*Columns*' selector in the list overview 
header allows to check/uncheck the different columns and display them in the list.
