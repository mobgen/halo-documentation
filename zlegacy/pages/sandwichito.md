# Introduction
In HALO we take really seriously the team work and working together to achieve amazing things. This is one of the reasons why we have the sandwichito time. This is the time after the standup when we prepare a sandwich and eat all together having fun.

Building a sandwich is a hard task that needs to be documented properly to avoid loosing the knowledge we've built upon this art of cooking. You can find here the detailed instructions with some images that will help you, as a team member, to prepare sandwiches correctly.

## Step 1: Prepare for the ritual

After the standup you should go to the kitchen and prepare some dishes according to the people in the team attending to the event.

## Step 2: Bring the bread

Take the package with fresh bread, making sure it has not fungi on it (this dish must be healthy).

Take 2 slices of bread per dish and put them opened so the sandwhich can be filled properly with some food. As an example, if we have 3 dishes you will have to take 6 slices (2*3).

## Step 3: Fill the food

For this step, some teamwork is needed to finish the process as fast as possible. Take the cheese and the ham (preferably 'JamÃ³n Serrano') and fill each sandwich with 2 slizes of cheese and 3 chunks of ham.

## Step 4: Close the door

Once the sandwich has all the food you need to close and wrap it to prepare for the heater. This is the most important process since a proper heating means a delicious sandwich.

## Step 5: Heat the sandwiches

Before putting the sandwich in the heater, you need to pre-heat it to make sure the temperature is optimal. The heater starts making some small 'crip crip' sounds when the status is the optimal one, so be prepared to put the sandwiches in.

## Step 6: Turn it around

The bests sandwiches are those which present squares in the center. This effect can be achieved by turning the sandwich around in the perfect moment. This moment can be detected looking the following signs:

- The bread is almost done but it is still soft
- The chease is not spreading yet through the sandwich
- Sergio is doing it, then you should do it as well

## Step 7: Get the sandwhich out

If you see this golden color ond the sandwhich and the awesome squares in the middle, yes, the sandwhich is in the perfect shape to take it out from the heater.

> Take a dish with you in this process or you will have to run like an idiot with the sandwhich to the table because it is too too hot.

## Step 8: Enjoy

After all this 5 min hard work, you will have this desired sandwhich that you can eat, enjoy and use as an excuse to tell some jokes to the people sit in front of you, those who helped you along this really hard quest.
