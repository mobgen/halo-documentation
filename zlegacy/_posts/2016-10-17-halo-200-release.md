After six months of hard work, the 2.0 version of HALO was released! During this process of development, the HALO team completely redesigned 
the user interface of the CMS and upgraded the backend system, enriching the app with both killer features and a cool new design. 

The new user interface of the CMS totally evolved in a cleaner, more attractive and customisable way to improve the user experience. 
In addition to the UI redesign, the user management system changed from role based to permission based. Now it is possible to have complete 
control over the different roles/permissions for each user. 

Simultaneously, the HALO SDKs improved considerably the modularity and stability as result of an exhaustive process of testing and code refactoring. 
Moreover, they have also enhanced the general architecture, improved the security and introduced the new app dashboard analytics.
