## Changelog

### Core SDK

* Make sure the `managerWillSetupDevice` gets called every time the app starts, so that any customisation can be performed by the developer.

### Notifications SDK

* Reduced the size of the SDK by improving the size of the sound files for the custom notifications sounds.
