## Login
To login with a HALO account firstly you may ask your admin to provide this account. HALO does not provide a public registration
form, so accounts are created in the scope of a company or project.

[Access to the CMS](https://web-halo.mobgen.com) and enter your credentials:

- Enter your **username** in the first field.
- Enter your **password** in the second field.
- You can **remember** your username to avoid entering it every time. **Password will not be stored for security reasons**.
- Press **login** to enter to your account.

You will be taken to a welcome message where you can start selecting the menu to access all the features available
as a customer.

## Logout

Once you are logged in you can perform a logout following the next steps:

- Go to the top bar (where you have the username).
- Click on the user image.
- A dialog will appear that says '*Logout*'.
- Once clicked you will be immediately logged out from HALO.
