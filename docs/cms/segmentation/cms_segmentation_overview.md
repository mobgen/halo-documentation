Segmentation is a key feature of HALO because it allows us to target specific users based on preferences, market, device type or any other feature you may
think is interesting for a user. Tags are attached to specific devices so we can reach those devices with the content they really need or the business is prepared to.

What the segmentation functionality allows to is:

- Segment the content items to users based on tags.
- Send notifications to specific group of users.
- Divide localized texts per language inside a content item.

Segmentation tags have 4 different categories:

- **Device**: default tags created with the default tags from the devices.
- **User**: custom tags created by users.
- **Market**: allows segmentation based on countries. This way the instances can be divided or used differently per country.
- **Language**: this tags contain all the standard languages in the world so the content can be segmented by language. For localized fields, all the tags attached as language tags to the content structure
are the ones that will be available as languages for the localization.

You can also add your own tags from the SDKs or directly from the CMS so they can be available for segmenting content.
