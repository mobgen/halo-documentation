# Loyalty

Using the loyalty module of HALO we can have promotions with our clients. The app can scan a BIDI code to redeem a stamp or a price discount (loyalty points), show details of the promotion and current number of stamp collected, redeem a gift and show updated results the operations.

The app uses the following libraries of HALO SDK:

- **HALO Loyalty API**: to generate and redeem promotion codes.
- **HALO Content API**: provides all the content of the app. See also [Content API](./android_content_overview.html).
- **HALO Auth API**: to login or create users. See also [Auth API](./android_auth_overview.html).


### BIDI Codes

The valid types for redeemables are stamps, items and prizes. Stamps are promotional codes that a user can redeem to collect badges until a number when the user can request a gift. Prizes are objects you can exchange for points, so they must have a non positive value in pointsOperated field. In case of items, the amount must be non negative.
