## Change server environment

Maybe you don't want to use HALO in the default production environment (<https://halo.mobgen.com>). To change the environment in which HALO is working on, you have to customize your installation process. See the example above:

```java
Halo.installer(context)
	.environment("https://halo-int.mobgen.com")
	.install();
```

## Disable SSL pinning

Maybe you don't want to use the SSL pinning in the HALO SDK that is enabled by default. To disable pinning you have to customize your installation process. This is not recomended but could be interesting for development purposes. See the example above:

```java
Halo.installer(context)
	.environment("https://halo-int.mobgen.com")
	.disablePinning()
	.install();
```

## Proxy debugging 

You must follow the next steps to debug all requests information with some proxy debugger like Charles.

### Install the certificate

You will need to install a certificate in your device to allow the proxy debugger application. If you are using Charles you can just download it from Help > Certificate.

### Trust on this certificate

You need to add configuration to your app in order to have it trust the SSL certificates generated by SSL proxying debugger. This means that you can only use SSL Proxying with apps that you control. You must override the [network security configuration](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config.html) as follows:

```
<network-security-config> 
  <debug-overrides> 
    <trust-anchors> 
      <!-- Trust user added CAs while debuggable only -->
      <certificates src="user" /> 
    </trust-anchors> 
  </debug-overrides> 
</network-security-config>
```

```
<applicationandroid:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ... >
        ...
</application>
```

### Disable SSL pinning

You must disable SSL pinning on the HALO installer as follows:

```java
Halo.installer(context)
	.environment("https://halo-int.mobgen.com")
	.disablePinning()
	.install();
```
