## Login
To login with a HALO account firstly you may ask your admin to provide this account. HALO does not provide a public registration
form, so accounts are created in the scope of a company or project.

[Access to the CMS](https://halo.mobgen.com) and enter your credentials:

1. Enter your **username** in the first field.
2. Enter your **password** in the second field.
3. You can **remember** your username to avoid entering it everytime. **Password will not be stored for secutiry reasons**.
4. Press **login** to enter to your account.

You will be taken to a welcome message where you can start selecting the menu to access all the features available
as a customer.
