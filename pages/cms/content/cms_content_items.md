## What is a content item?

A content item is one of each elements that can be consumed from an application and that defines the behavior of this application.
content items must match with the fields of a content structure (for more information about content structures [click here](./cms_content_modules.html))
and its fields contain the information that will be consumed.

Content items can be created, saved as draft, published, archived and deleted. Here we are describing how to operate over this content
items to change their states. The description of the states are:

1. **Created**: You can create a content item by filling the title for this item. This is the only mandatory information, since
all the fields are optional.
2. **Saved as draft**: Once you create an item it will not be published by default. This item will be saved as draft unless you click on
   '*Publish now*'. Saved as draft items can be changed and scheduled for publication, but they are not actually published.
3. **Published**: Those are the considered visible items for the apps. A content item can be '*Unpublished*' and will not be visible anymore 
and change its status to Saved as draft. 
1. **Archived**: A published content item can be archived using the '*Archive*' button or automatically is changed to this state 
when reaches the '*Archive on*' date.
5. **Deleted**: Every element deleted in the CMS has a logic deletion, so the information can be retrieved by an administrator
   if it would be possible.
   
The state flow of the content items respond to this following state diagram.
